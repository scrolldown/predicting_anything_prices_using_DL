# predicting_anything_prices_using_DL

## using keras
## using CNN-LSTM
All models provided by Keras can be used.

## using only close prices
But if you want, you can use various features if you modify it a little.

## To improve performance, using by log and difference
and the scalar value called 'scaler' is multiplied.

## using grid-search to optimize hyper parameter
If you modify only the top the 'Train_model.py', you can modify it to the search option you want.

## Save the model with the highest accuracy as an H5 file
The prediction plot at the time is also saved as jpg.

## using 'Predict_Tomorrow_By_AI.py' to predicting tomorrow's price
S&P 500 close price csv file is needed until today.
