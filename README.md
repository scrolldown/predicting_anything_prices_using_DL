+ <b>using keras

+ using CNN-LSTM
> All models provided by Keras can be used.

<br>
  
+ using only close prices
> But if you want, you can use various features if you modify it a little.

<br>
  
+ To improve performance, using by log and difference
> and the scalar value called 'scaler' is multiplied.

<br>
  
+ using grid-search to optimize hyper parameter
> If you modify only the top the 'Train_model.py', you can modify it to the search option you want.

<br>
  
+ Save the model with the highest accuracy as an H5 file
> The prediction plot at the time is also saved as jpg.

<br>
  
+ using 'Predict_Tomorrow_By_AI.py' to predicting tomorrow's price
> S&P 500 close price csv file is needed until today.
